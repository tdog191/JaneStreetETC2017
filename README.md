# JaneStreetETC2017
Electronic Trading Competition powered by Jane Street

I competed in the competition with Thomas Warther(tdog191) and Chiranjeev Puri (CSP197)
<br>
We built a bot to do bond trading and came in ninth place during the lightning round.
<br>
We used mathematical calculations to determine proper "buy low" prices and "sell high" prices.
<br>
The trading bot is very simple, but helped us very much in the competition.
